# Micro-blog
## fac22 Week 1 Project by Michael, Mohamed and Barbara

## Task
<https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/apprenticeship/server/project/>

Your project this week is to build a microblogging site. It should allow users to submit their own posts and view all the posts submitted by others.

Note: we aren’t expecting the data to persist when the server restarts (we’ll be looking at databases for this next week).

### User stories -> make each into an issue
Core 
- As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
- As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted
Stretch 
- As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore

### Acceptance Criteria 
- A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- No .html files (all HTML responses should be created dynamically within Node)
- No client-side JavaScript (all logic should happen on the server)
- All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- Tests for each server route
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
